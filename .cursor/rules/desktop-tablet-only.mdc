# Desktop & Tablet Only — Do Not Change Mobile

When making design, layout, or styling changes in this project:

- **Change only** desktop and tablet breakpoints (e.g. `md:`, `lg:`, `xl:` and up, or `hidden md:block` / desktop-only sections).
- **Do not change** mobile-only markup or styles (e.g. `md:hidden` blocks, or base/unprefixed classes that affect mobile).
- If a component has separate mobile vs desktop blocks, edit only the desktop (and tablet) block; leave the mobile block untouched.

This applies to CSS/Tailwind, component structure, and any UI that has distinct mobile vs desktop implementations.

**Exception:** Only apply changes to mobile when the user explicitly asks for a mobile-only change (e.g. "on mobile only", "mobile should..."). Otherwise assume desktop/tablet only.
